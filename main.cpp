My last project was about creating simulation Mes Networ. A MES is a manufacturing executiion system, which is collecting data about all device working on the production hall. In my project I was focusing to write this software in flexible way, to have oportunity to connect easly many difrent devices. Also I made this software in two version. First one as a multithreading version with where i use lock_guard, unique_lock and condition variable to provide correct  synchronization  between threads.
And second version as a multiprocessing, where I use logfile provided by LInux operating system to achive this same gol.
